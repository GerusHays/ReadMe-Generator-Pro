# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to generate a professional ReadMe for any projects the user is working on. </br>
To be able to use this the user needs to download it first and install the npm package by entering in npm install within the root of the file path. </br>
Once that step is complete the user will need to interact with the terminal and enter in what they want as their inputs. </br>
Upon completing all of the required inputs the user may open their readMe file and be presented with what they entered. 
## Built With
* Inquirer package
* JS

## Resources and Student cohesion
- https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba used this link to get the license badges
- I finished the project with the help of my tutor and office hours with TA and Tess Shearer

## Moving Forward
- I need to figure out why the confirmation shows up as false instead of just not displaying anything.
